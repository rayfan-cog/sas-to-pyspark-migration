# SAS to PySpark Migration Demo

This repository demonstrates how [Devin](https://devin.ai) can accelerate SAS-to-PySpark migration for financial services organizations. Using a real-world home equity loan dataset, we show five complete migration examples — from basic data loading to logistic regression modeling — with side-by-side SAS and PySpark code, inline comments mapping each SAS construct to its PySpark equivalent, and validation tests to ensure correctness.

Built for teams evaluating a move from SAS to open-source distributed computing on platforms like Databricks, Amazon EMR, or Azure Synapse.

## Why Migrate?

| Driver | Details |
|---|---|
| **Scalability** | PySpark runs on distributed clusters, processing terabytes of data across hundreds of nodes — far beyond SAS's single-server architecture. |
| **Cost** | PySpark is open-source (Apache 2.0). Eliminating SAS licensing fees can save millions annually for large enterprises. |
| **Cloud-Native** | PySpark is the native compute engine for Databricks, Amazon EMR, Azure Synapse, and Google Dataproc — enabling seamless cloud adoption. |
| **Modern ML Ecosystem** | Direct integration with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MLflow, and the broader Python data science ecosystem. |

## Migration Examples

| # | SAS Program | PySpark Script | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `sas/01_data_loading.sas` | `pyspark/01_data_loading.py` | Load CSV, apply labels/formats, inspect metadata, preview data |
| 2 | `sas/02_data_cleaning.sas` | `pyspark/02_data_cleaning.py` | Derived columns (LTV, loan outcome), missing value handling, outlier detection |
| 3 | `sas/03_aggregation_reporting.sas` | `pyspark/03_aggregation_reporting.py` | Frequency tables, summary statistics, cross-tabulation, SQL queries |
| 4 | `sas/04_risk_segmentation.sas` | `pyspark/04_risk_segmentation.py` | Risk bucketing (LTV, DTI, delinquency), composite scoring, segment analysis |
| 5 | `sas/05_logistic_regression.sas` | `pyspark/05_logistic_regression.py` | Logistic regression with feature engineering, model evaluation, AUC/confusion matrix |

## How Devin Helps

Devin automates the heavy lifting of SAS-to-PySpark migration:

1. **Reads and understands SAS code** — Devin parses DATA steps, PROC procedures, macro variables, and SAS-specific constructs to understand the full intent of each program.

2. **Generates idiomatic PySpark equivalents** — Rather than a literal line-by-line translation, Devin produces clean, Pythonic PySpark code that follows Spark best practices (lazy evaluation, DataFrame API, ML Pipelines).

3. **Writes validation tests** — Devin automatically generates test suites that verify row counts, column existence, derived column calculations, and model outputs match expected results.

4. **Documents the migration mapping** — Devin produces comprehensive reference guides mapping every SAS construct (PROC MEANS, PROC FREQ, DATA step arrays, macro variables) to its PySpark equivalent.

## Migration Patterns

The [`migration_guide/`](migration_guide/) folder contains detailed reference documentation:

- **[SAS to PySpark Mapping](migration_guide/sas_to_pyspark_mapping.md)** — Complete reference table covering DATA step operations, statistical procedures, ML, macro language, and data management constructs.
- **[Common Patterns](migration_guide/common_patterns.md)** — Seven detailed side-by-side examples of the most frequently encountered migration patterns, including data loading, conditional logic, missing values, aggregation, joins, macros, and output writing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Java 8 or 11 (required by PySpark)

### Installation

```bash
pip install pyspark
```

### Running the PySpark Scripts

Each script is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# From the repository root directory
python pyspark/01_data_loading.py
python pyspark/02_data_cleaning.py
python pyspark/03_aggregation_reporting.py
python pyspark/04_risk_segmentation.py
python pyspark/05_logistic_regression.py
```

### Running the Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_pyspark_outputs.py -v
```

Or with unittest directly:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_pyspark_outputs -v
```

`pytest.ini` sets `addopts = -ra`, so every skipped or xfailed test is listed in the
run summary — a green run can never hide a test that never executed.

---

### SAS parity (golden outputs)

Proving the PySpark code matches SAS requires reference numbers from a real SAS run.
`sas/99_export_golden.sas` exports them and the checked-in set under
[`tests/parity/golden/`](tests/parity/golden/README.md) came from an actual SAS 9.4
session (provenance and log committed alongside it). Compare against them with:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/parity -v
```

`tests/parity/pipeline.py` reimplements loading, cleaning and risk segmentation as
importable functions, and `tests/parity/test_golden_parity.py` asserts row counts and
frequencies exactly and continuous statistics to 1e-9.

#### Missing golden files: skip locally, fail in CI

By default the parity module skips itself when a golden CSV is absent, rather than
asserting against invented numbers — never hand-write them. Set `REQUIRE_GOLDEN=1` to
turn that skip into a hard failure, so a run cannot report success while parity was
never verified:

```bash
REQUIRE_GOLDEN=1 python -m pytest tests -v -ra
```

`.github/workflows/tests.yml` exports `REQUIRE_GOLDEN=1` for the whole job, so CI always
requires the golden set to be present.

#### Golden-set validation

`tests/parity/test_golden_contract.py` runs before the comparisons and checks each
required golden CSV against the contract in `tests/parity/golden_contract.py`: the file
exists, is non-empty, parses as CSV, has the expected header, and contains the expected
key rows (the three `row_counts` stages, both `LOAN_OUTCOME` levels, all four risk
segments) with no blank cells. A truncated or mis-exported golden set therefore fails as
a golden-set defect instead of looking like a parity mismatch. The contract mirrors
[`tests/parity/golden/README.md`](tests/parity/golden/README.md).

## Dataset

The `data/home_equity.csv` file contains 5,960 home equity loan records with 18 columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `BAD` | Loan default flag (1 = default, 0 = paid) |
| `LOAN` | Amount of loan request |
| `MORTDUE` | Amount due on existing mortgage |
| `VALUE` | Value of current property |
| `REASON` | Loan purpose (HomeImp or DebtCon) |
| `JOB` | Job category |
| `YOJ` | Years at present job |
| `DEROG` | Number of derogatory reports |
| `DELINQ` | Number of delinquent credit lines |
| `CLAGE` | Age of oldest credit line (months) |
| `NINQ` | Number of recent credit inquiries |
| `CLNO` | Number of credit lines |
| `DEBTINC` | Debt to income ratio |
| `APPDATE` | Loan application date |
| `CITY` | City |
| `STATE` | State |
| `DIVISION` | Census division |
| `REGION` | Census region |
